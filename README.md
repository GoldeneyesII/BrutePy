# BrutePy
BrutePy is something I am designing in an attempt to make a lightweight 'dictionary' generator. It is meant to create words using sequential characters, always changing the far-right character until it reaches the last value in the set, and then incrementing the next character over by one. Exactly like a numerical counting system.
