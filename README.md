# BrutePy
BrutePy is something I am designing in an attempt to make a lightweight 'dictionary' generator. It is meant to create words using sequential characters, always changing the far-right character until it reaches the last value in the set, and then incrementing the next character over by one. Exactly like a numerical counting system.

In essence, this will create a list of strings of characters selected from a set, so that these 'word lists' can be used with Pen-Testing. 

While the concept is quite basic, I do plan to add features to it and to make it increasingly versatile, with no definite ending in mind. 

In light of this, whenever a new option, feature, or major change is implemented, this ReadMe is to have a new section created detailing What changes were made, Why they were made, and How exactly they work.

If anyone has any suggestions, feature ideas, coding tweaks or corrections, or general tips, please do not hesitate to inform me of them. This is one of the first projects I have ever started on, and any help is appreciated!

Thank you, and enjoy BrutePy!
